# CollapseSynth
Work in Progress collaborative modular software synth

experimental branch is in active development and here to keep track of new feautures that are being worked on.

these include midi integration and experimental clmface tracker filter module 

next big steps are reviewing parts of the code that are not neccesary anymore, 
rewriting the modules to keep track of their latest data saved in the socket,
and finding a way to host collapse synth completely online on it's own dedicated website
